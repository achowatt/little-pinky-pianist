			<p>Anna is a versatile pianist, explorer and improviser. When she is not playing classical music, she spends her time jazzing up, exploring different harmonies, and finding beautiful melodies. Earlier in her career, she studied classical piano with Tina Yanchus, a Julliard alumni at Western University. There she found her passion for jazz and continued her study at Mohawk College under Adrean Farrugia, a Juno nominated pianist. In 2019, she received a Masters Degree for Jazz Performance at Bowling Green State University in USA, where she further developed her jazz skills under the guidance of Ariel Kasler, a talented Berklee College of Music alumni.</p>

		<h2>Lesson</h2>
		<div class="content single-column">
			<p>I believe that music is one of the most wonderful gifts that one could share with the world. As a versatile musician who is trained in both classical and jazz, music to me, has no limits and is not bounded to one particular genre. My teaching philosophy involves creating a supportive and a stimulating environment for my students to explore and to challenge themselves at their own pace. As each student is different, I have learned to embrace all of their individuality and tailored my lessons to fit their learning habits.</p>
			<p>Throughout my teaching experiences, I believe that it is important to incorporate theory, history, composition and arrangement into my lessons, while fostering good piano techniques. In doing so, my students will develop not only a deeper understanding of the music that they play, but also a greater appreciation for the music when they see it in context. I am also an advocate for learning music by ear and improvising, as these skills are essential to becoming a well-rounded pianist who is completely “free.” </p>
			<p>My approach to teaching is very situational and varies depending on the age and the experience of the student. For younger beginner students, I have taught my students to read notes and learn rhythm through flashcards, recordings, and even through their own composition and improvisation. Rather than teaching straight from the book, I am an advocate for other means of creativity and exploration. For more advanced students, I focus more on their technique, style, and expression while incorporating some aspect of improvisation and ear training into the lesson.</p>
			<p>Overall, my goal to motivate my students to become more versatile, well informed, creative, and self-sufficient. I aspire to build confidence in my students and to inspire them to find joy in music making!</p>
